##  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
Before visualization, data was cleaned using **Power Query (M Language)**:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Removed null values and filled missing prices using the previous day's values.
2. **Date Formatting**: Ensured all dates were in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
3. **Data Type Correction**: Converted numerical values (Open, Close, High, Low, Volume, MarketCap) to `Decimal`.
4. **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminated duplicate records for accuracy.
5. **Column Standardization**: Renamed columns for clarity.

##  **DAX Calculations Used**
Below are the **DAX formulas** used to derive insights:

### **1 Moving Average Calculation** (For Trend Analysis)
```DAX
MovingAvg = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(Crypto[Close]), 
    DATESINPERIOD(Crypto[Date], MAX(Crypto[Date]), -7, DAY)
)
```
This helps smooth out price fluctuations over a 7-day window.

### **2 Percentage Change Calculation** (Daily Change in Price)
```DAX
% Change = 
VAR PrevClose = LOOKUPVALUE(Crypto[Close], Crypto[Date], EARLIER(Crypto[Date])-1)
RETURN IF(ISBLANK(PrevClose), BLANK(), (Crypto[Close] - PrevClose) / PrevClose * 100)
```
Shows the percentage increase/decrease in price from the previous day.

### **3 Total Market Cap Calculation**
```DAX
TotalMarketCap = SUM(Crypto[Marketcap])
```
Calculates the overall market capitalization of selected cryptocurrencies.
